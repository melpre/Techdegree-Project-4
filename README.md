 My 4th project: OOP Game Show App

 This app showcases object oriented programming by simulating a phrase guessing game. The onscreen keyboard as well as the user's physical keyboard can be used to guess each letter in the phrase. The game ends when either the user guesses the complete phrase or loses all 5 heart lives. In both events, the 'Start Game' button resets and starts a new game.

 Style changes made to the app: font, start game page's background color, lose game page's background color
